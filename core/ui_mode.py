"""Which look a viewer gets: the redesigned panel, or the one that was live before.

Why this exists
---------------
The redesign replaced the shell (core/base.html) and three pages outright. Some
people want the new look, some want the old one, so both ship side by side and
each viewer picks for themselves from the profile menu.

How the choice is stored
------------------------
In the session, not the database. That means no migration, it survives a logout
(the session cookie outlives it) and it is per browser - which is what a "let me
try the new look" switch should be. Nothing about a person's data or permissions
changes with it; it only decides which template renders.

The default is OLD on purpose: nobody's screen changes until they opt in.
