"""Fill the KPI caches ahead of time so no real visitor pays the SAP wait.

Run it on a schedule (every 5 minutes is a good start):

    python manage.py warm_kpi_cache

It builds the top-strip ticker for the current month, and by default the
previous month too, because every "vs last month" figure needs it.

It used to warm the home-page KPI cards as well. That page is gone - Sales is
the main page now - so nothing reads that cache any more and warming it would
only cost SAP round-trips for figures no one would see.
